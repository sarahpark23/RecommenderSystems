# Recommending Beers: An Example of a Content-Based Recommender System

This repo illustrates how to create a content-based recommender system for beers given the [beer reviews dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/demo-datasets/beer_reviews.tar.gz). Please download the dataset first before starting.

Otherwise, a truncated beer reviews dataset is made [available](truncated_beer_reviews.csv). Use this instead if downloading the original dataset takes forever. Load the truncated data and skip lines 2 - 4 of [notebook](recommending_beers_content-based.ipynb).


Special thanks to Nikos for sharing this example!
